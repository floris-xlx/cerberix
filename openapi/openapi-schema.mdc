# OpenAPI authoring guardrails

- Always set `servers` to real domains or stage URLs, never localhost/example.
- Include `info.license` with a valid `name` and `url`.
- Every operation needs:
  - `operationId` (unique, stable verbs like `loginUser`).
  - At least one `4XX` response describing client errors.
  - A `2XX` success response.
- Define `security` at the root; only set `security: []` per-operation for truly public endpoints like `/health`.
- Prefer reusable schemas in `components` and reference them with `$ref`.
- Keep request/response bodies typed; mark required fields explicitly.
